SimpleMaps Project 
SimpleMaps is an academic project that was set up with the aim of creating a collaborative system accessed through the internet, in which users can search for geographic locations and interact with maps, inserting multimedia objects that represent their emotions and perceptions from places they usually go to. 
Such objects can be images, videos, audio files, text or even pictures on the map. By inserting these artifacts on the map, they should be geo-coded, which means, each object must have a latitude and longitude value associated. 

Target Audience 
The system was idealized to be used for social purposes. System users would be the community members and each user could portray the community where they live under their own perspective, indicating places that they usually go to, sharing the music they like to listen to, pictures and videos that represent their daily routine. Every information collected would be analyzed, for example, by a social worker or other professional who interacts with the community. 
Despite the initial idea, the system is available to the entire community and anyone can use it for recreational or business purposes.
